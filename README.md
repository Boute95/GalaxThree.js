## What it is ?
GalaxThree is a true-scale proceduraly generated galaxy in the browser using **ThreeJS** and some **GLSL** shaders. The galaxy can have about **10 billion of stars** on a decent computer. 

It uses an image of the galaxy with a RGB edited version of it to generate the stars. In theory, it can generate any type of spiral galaxy (and also lenticular galaxies), as long as it has the images to generate it.
